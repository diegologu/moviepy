## How to run  
You can run the file called *FinalScript.py* that will create a file called *FinalVideo.mp4* on the *output* folder.
You can also try the notebook version on binder but you will not be able to put an overlay text as it has to be done locally.  
*NOTE: If you are on windows you must install imagemagick from [here](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) and make sure to select [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68244128) configuration during installation*
