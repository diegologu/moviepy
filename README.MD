David Galvis  
Juan Estrada  
Diego Lopez  
Jose Pinzon  


## How to run  
You can run the file called *FinalScript.py* that will create a file called *FinalVideo.mp4* on the *output* folder.
You can also try the notebook version on binder but you will not be able to put an overlay text as it has to be done locally.
